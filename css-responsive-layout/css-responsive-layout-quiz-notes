## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  Breakpoints are used to apply different styles at different screen sizes to ensure that the content is displayed optimally across various devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  provides greater flexibility and adaptability in a responsive layout.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  This is due to the CSS cascade, where later rules in the stylesheet take precedence over earlier ones if they have the same specificity.
