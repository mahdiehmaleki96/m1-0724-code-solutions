## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What HTML tag is used to link to another website?
  <a> (anchor) tag
- What is an absolute URL?
  An absolute URL is a complete URL that includes all the information necessary to locate a resource. It includes the protocol (such as http or https), domain name, and path to the specific resource. An absolute URL allows us to access the resource from any location.
- What is a relative URL?
  A relative URL is a URL that provides a path relative to the current document's location. It does not include the protocol or domain name, only the path to the resource. Relative URLs are useful for linking to resources within the same website without needing to specify the full URL.
