## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a block of code that performs a particular task. We define parameters and call the function with the arguments later in the code. we can call the function as many times as we need.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword, the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, the function body in curly braces, and the return type which is optional.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function name, and a list of arguments in parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function definition includes the function's name, parameters, and body, while a function call only includes the function's name and arguments.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a variable in the function definition, while an argument is the value passed to the function when it is called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters allow functions to accept input values, making them more flexible and reusable.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It specifies the value to be returned by the function.
  It immediately stops the execution of the function, meaning any code after the return statement will not be executed.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  the function keyword is not used and an arrow [=>] is used between the parameter list and code block.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  The return statement is implicit, meaning the function automatically returns the result of the expression.
