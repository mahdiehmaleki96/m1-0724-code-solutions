## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `event.target`?
  refers to the element that triggered the event.
- What is the effect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  completely removes the element from the document flow. This means the element will not be visible on the page and will not occupy any space.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes a CSS selector string as an argument. It returns true if the element matches the given selector, and false otherwise.
- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  getAttribute method
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  Debugging
  Event Handling
  Condition Checking
  Function Calls
- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  addEventListener
- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  Then I would need to write individual code for each view.
