## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the difference between an ordered list and an unordered list in HTML?
  An ordered list (<ol>) displays items in a specific sequence, typically with numbers or letters indicating the order. An unordered list (<ul>) displays items without a specific sequence, typically with bullet points.
- Is an HTML list a block element or an inline element?
  An HTML list, both ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>), is a block-level element. This means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available by default.
