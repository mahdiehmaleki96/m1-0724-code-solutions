## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the six primary HTML elements for creating tables?
<table>: to define a table in HTML.
<tr>: to define a row in a table.
<td>: to define a cell in a table.
<th>: to define a header cell in a table. These cells are usually bold and centered.
<thead>: to group the header content in a table.
<tbody>: to group the body content in a table.
- What purpose do the `thead` and `tbody` elements serve?
  The <thead> element is used to group the header rows in a table. The <thead> is useful for styling and scripting purposes, and it helps to make the table more accessible by clearly separating the header from the body of the table.
  The <tbody> element is used to group the body content in a table. By grouping the body content, <tbody> helps to keep the table organized and can also be used for styling and scripting.
- Give two examples of data that would lend itself well to being displayed in a table.
  Student Grades: A table can display student grades, with columns for student names, subjects, and their respective grades. This format allows for easy comparison and organization of data.
  Product Inventory: A table can be used to display product inventory, with columns for product names, quantities, prices, and categories. This helps in managing and tracking inventory efficiently.
