## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSON?
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- What are serialization and deserialization?
  Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored, transferred, or processed, such as a JSON string.
  Deserialization is the reverse process, where a serialized format (such as a JSON string) is converted back into the original data structure or object.
- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
  Data exchange: Serialization enables easy data transfer between different systems or platforms over a network, especially when transmitting structured data like JSON.
  Storage: Serialized data can be saved to a file or database and later retrieved or processed.
  Interoperability: Different programming languages can easily interpret serialized formats like JSON, enhancing cross-platform communication.
- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using TypeScript?
  JSON.stringify()
- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using TypeScript?
  JSON.parse()
